# Service Worker: Simple Example

The Service Worker is a script that runs in the background of your browser, operating independently of a web page. It enables features that don't require user interaction or an active web page. Currently, it supports functionalities like push notifications and background sync.

## How to Use This Example

To get started, follow the instructions below:

### Installing Dependencies

First and foremost, install the project dependencies. Run the following command in the terminal to ensure that all Service Worker features are supported:

`yarn install`

### Project Compilation

After installing the dependencies, build the project using the command:

`yarn start`

This command sets up the environment for the Service Worker to function correctly.

By following these simple steps, you can test the example. Remember that the Service Worker operates in the background, providing a more efficient and dynamic user experience without the need for constant interaction.

#### Important Notes

Make sure you have Node.js and yarn installed on your system before you begin.
This is a basic example. Customize it according to your needs and integrate it into your project as desired.
